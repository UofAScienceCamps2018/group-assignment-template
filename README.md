# Group Assignment Template

### Rules
1. Make sure that you try to understand all of the code in the project, whether you or your group member wrote it
2. Try to contribute to all aspects of the project (working on each function *together* is better than splitting up the work)
2. Asking peers (in/out of your group) for help is okay, but try not to copy and paste their code
3. If you get any code from peers (in/out of your group) or online sources, cite your sources
4. Make sure your code is compatible with Python3 (some things you look up will work for Python2 but not Python3)

**General rule of thumb:** If you can explain your code in your own words, that proves that you can understand it


### Code formatting
An example has been provided in this repository, and is linked [here](https://github.com/UofAScienceCamps2018/group-assignment-template/blob/master/group-template.py)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

"""
The name of your file
First and last names of all group members

Description of your file

A link to any external sources you use
*** looking online for help is fine, just make sure you provide a link to the websites you used ***
"""

# Import statements, in alphabetical order

# Public variables (try to avoid using them if possible)


# Comment that describes the following code/function
# Names of all the people that contributed to the following code/function
# *** if everyone contributed, write "all" ***
def function1():
  # Code here
  
  
# Comment that describes the following code/function
# Names of all the people that contributed to the following code/function
